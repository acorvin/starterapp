# Node Starter App

This is a simple Node.js project that incorporates the Express framework, EJS templating and Bootstrap 5. It is designed to serve as a starting point for building web applications using these technologies.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Change into the directory:

```
cd starterapp
```

- Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

- Start the server:

```
node server.js
```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You should see a "Hello, World!" message displayed.

To modify the application, you can edit the home.ejs file in the views directory. This file contains the EJS template that is used to generate the HTML for the page.

You can also modify the server.js file to add additional routes or functionality to the application.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- Express server with basic routing
- EJS templating engine for dynamic views
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and styling
